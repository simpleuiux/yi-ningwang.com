### How to age happily? Like a woman over 50.

###### - Re-define healthy ageing with Age Sister.

---

**BRIEF**

Ageing is the term that we want all to ran away from. It’s happening every day, but we tend to ignore it. Kate Milne noticed that women, especially aged 50–70 years old, are among the most under-served population. She then started her health consultancy firm in Vancouver with the focus to help women ageing in a happier and healthier way.

> As women, we take care of everyone else before we take care of ourselves. As we move into our 50s and beyond, self-care is more important than ever before. Women over 50 have a unique opportunity to dramatically change the course of their aging and overall quality of life, just by making simple lifestyle changes.
> — Kate Milne, the founder of Age Sister

It’s almost new year again! After the busy Christmas with numerous work dinners and family gatherings, Linda finally has time to sit down and reflect on what she has done during this year. There were a few things that she wished she had done but overall, she was proud of herself that she managed to spend time on the new knitting hobby that she developed. After the reflections, Linda wrote down a list of things she wants to accomplish in the following year. Similar to her friend’s list, she wants to spend more time with her family, try to eat out less and cook more and to exercise more…

- As a busy freelancer who frequently has no time to join studio exercises, I want to be able to have a website that shows me easy steps to easy exercises so that I can make it a home morning routine.
- As a woman who notices visible signs of aging, I want to be a part of a community where I can share my thoughts can feelings so that I can feel supported

</div>

- Two different mood boards are presented to the client. The brownish-yellow colours helps whole website pop up visually with vibrant atmosphere while The blue version on the right conveyed a resilient feeling.
- Age Sister would like to present a happy and revitalized vibe to gladden users; therefore, the browish-yellow serve as the final decision.

![Logo Design](https://miro.medium.com/max/1440/1*k4X2RHW-Bg7R-6QbmQnZtA.png)

</div>

- I want to make the logo fluid and full of feminine gestures. There are the several variation of the logo design. The idea is that the logo is formed by the elements that can be reconstruced, to make it a dynamic logo.

</div>

- Colours | Teal, brownish to yellow colour palette creates a natural vibe that makes our users get a more energetic and healthy tone. I chose side colours with the same hue to provide warmth and consistency.
- Typography | We chose Metropolis and Futura; both are the san-serif fonts that give a neat feeling. Both are a minimalist sans-serif typeface of the new millennium that goes well together. Since we are targeting for elders. We looked for fonts designed for optimal readability at a small point size while beautiful at large point sizes.
- Design Elements | For the UI elements, I wanted it to have importance and to shine so I add heavy dark lines. I added CTA (Call To Action) buttons with a bright colour so it can pop and stand out.
