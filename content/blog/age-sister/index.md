REDESIGN USER EXPERIENCE TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE FOR USERS OVER 50</h3>

> As women, we take care of everyone else before we take care of ourselves. When we move into our 50s and beyond, self-care is more important than ever before.
>
> — Kate Milne, the founder of Age Sister

Ageing is happening every day, but we usually ignore it. Kate Milne noticed that women, especially aged from 50 to 70 years old, are among the most under-served population. She started Age Sister, a health consultancy firm, in Vancouver to help women ageing in a happier and healthier way.

After the busy Christmas, Linda finally has time to sit down and reflect on what she has done during this year. After the reflections, Linda wrote a list of things she wants to accomplish next year. She wants to have more time for her own, try to eat out less and cook more and to exercise more…

mood board </h6>

<p style=" margin-bottom:-50px">
There are two mood boards for the client. The brownish-yellow colours help the whole website pop up visually with <b>a vibrant atmosphere</b> while the blue version on the right <b>conveyed a resilient feeling</b>. </br>
Age Sister would like to present a happy and revitalized vibe to gladden users. Therefore, the brownish-yellow serve as the final decision.

embody the dynamic and fluidity of femininity </h3>

<p style=" margin-bottom:-50px">
I want to make a dynamic logo with feminine gestures. There are several variations in the logo design. We can reorganize the elements of logo that changed in several ways, make it a changable and adaptable.

a good branding is its consistency</h3>

<p style=" margin-bottom:-50px">
<b>Colours</b> | Teal, brownish and yellow colour palette provides a energetic and healthy tone. </br>
<b>Typography</b> | Metropolis and Futura are both minimalistic san-serif font that give a neat feeling. They were chosen for the accessibility reason. It is easier for elders to read at either small or large font size.</br>
<b>Design Elements</b> | I added CTA (Call To Action) buttons with a bright colour so it can pop and stand out.
